 ### Important Info
 For dataNew.npy and labelsNew.npy, there is no preprocessing, just raw data
 
 For the x and y coordinate, they are where they are in the image, just between 0 and 1
 
 The width and height of the images are 200x200, in case we need it for preprocessing


### Other Info
Remember to install the libraries in requirements.txt

opencv-python is cv2
