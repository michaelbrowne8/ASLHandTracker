 ### Important Info
 For dataNew.npy and labelsNew.npy, there is no preprocessing, just raw data
 
 For the x and y coordinate, they are where they are in the image, just between 0 and 1
 
 The width and height of the images are 200x200, in case we need it for preprocessing


### Other Info
Remember to install the libraries in requirements.txt

opencv-python is cv2

Getting this stuff onto your computer and being connected to the github is hard and weird to do, so try getting Github Desktop and make a new folder in your computer for project. Then click the green code button in the top right, choose open with github desktop, and you can push and pull easily with there if you don't know git commands like commit, push, pull.
